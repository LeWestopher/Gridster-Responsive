OMG I sooo wanted "jarvis widgets"
--------------

If you ever see those fancy bootstrap admin templates you might have came across Jarvis Widgets 2.0. Jarvis adds more then just a delete option to a dashboard "widget", he lets you customize them a bit more.

I wanted to make my own "dashboard" and Jarvis had the idea, just not a MIT based source code, so here we are...

Dashboard Widgets
--------------

Every admin panel has a dash board but there are no real, free, solutions to enable developers to add these dashboard control features without doing ALL the work themselves. My goal of this project is to create an open source version of "Jarvis Widgets" that everyone can use for free.

**Have a widget request?**

Let me know! As the development goes on I will be adding more widget control features.
